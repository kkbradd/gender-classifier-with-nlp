## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the gender of individuals based on their textual descriptions. It involves text preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains gender labels and textual descriptions. It was collected from various sources and preprocessed to remove missing values and irrelevant information.

## Preprocessing
Text preprocessing involves cleaning the text data by removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, tokenization, removing stop words, and lemmatization.

## Feature Engineering
The text data is converted into numerical features using techniques such as Bag of Words or TF-IDF vectorization. These features represent the textual information in a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

## Model Training
Several machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest are trained on the feature-engineered data to classify gender based on textual descriptions.

## Evaluation
The trained models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their performance in predicting gender from textual descriptions.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the preprocessing script to clean and preprocess the dataset.
3. Run the feature engineering script to generate numerical features from text data.
4. Train the machine learning models using the provided scripts.
5. Evaluate the trained models and choose the best-performing one for predictions.
